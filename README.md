# A couple of plans for the website

## Homepage
-Further Design The Frontpage:
This fits into three main components:
1. More components. What Other Elements should populate the front page?
	-A short breakdown of what the site is about etc.
	-Example cards.
2. Make current components interactive:
	-Implement spin animation of Hero icon
	-Make navbar semi-functional
	-Implement fancy issue buttons
3. Tweak and personalise design
	-Focus on making personal reusable buttons.
	-Find better colour scheme etc

## Some extra stuff
-Write down on paper my component based article idea. Build individual frames which each contain snippets of information and interactivity that woven together to
communicate information. Based on the ABC story lab. Goal is for these components to become reusable so that building articles is easy.

-Additionally, I need to think about how to create these articles. Do I want to pass in static props that next then builds into html with dynamic paths? Or should I focus on static paths
an implement that functionality later.

## Longterm
1. Post to Git
2. Create readme.md
3. Create documentation for reusability
4. Create a blog that documents the process of each day
